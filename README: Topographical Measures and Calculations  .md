# Topographical Measures and Calculations 📏🗺️

This repository contains tools and workflows for performing topographical calculations and processing using Python. It includes notebooks for free station adjustment and planimetric leveling.

# 🚀 Features

1. Free Station Adjustment

- Calculate and adjust coordinates for free stations using observation data.

2. Planimetric Leveling

- Perform planimetric measurements and verify leveling data with a structured workflow.
3. Customizable Parameters

- Adaptable notebooks for various topographical datasets and field requirements.
# 📂 Folder Structure
- station_libre.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook for free station adjustment and calculations.

- cheminement_planimetrique_betaversion.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook for planimetric leveling and data validation.

- data/

(Optional) Folder for input and output data, such as observation tables and results.

- docs/screenshots/

(Optional) Contains visualizations of outputs, such as plots and calculation tables.

# 📋 How to Use
1. Prepare the Environment

Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed:

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
2. Run the Notebooks

Open the desired notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab:

    jupyter notebook station_libre.ipynb
    # OR
    jupyter notebook cheminement_planimetrique_betaversion.ipynb
3. Provide Input Data
- Place your observation data (e.g., coordinates, leveling measurements) in the appropriate format (CSV or manual entry in the notebook).
- Modify input file paths or parameters in the notebook as needed.
4. Execute and Review
- Run all cells in the notebook to perform calculations.
- View and export results such as adjusted coordinates or leveled measurements.
